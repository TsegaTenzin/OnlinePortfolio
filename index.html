    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Tenzin Tsega. TBH I'm a little bit afraid but 
        well that ain't stopping me at this moment.
        <br />
        I have loved computer since Grade 6, I think. And Web development
        is how I came across the concept of programming. So even though 
        it may not be love, I like it.
